# MINTING-NFTS BY JS CODE
# Description:
The JavaScript code you're creating is designed to handle NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens). It defines a function that contains an object called "nft" with properties such as color, creator, value, and name. The object is then pushed into an array. Additionally, there are two more functions: one that lists out the details of each NFT using a for loop, and another that calculates the total supply of NFTs.

# Prerequisites:
To understand and work with this code, you should have a basic understanding of JavaScript, including knowledge of objects, arrays, functions, and loops.

# Step-by-step summary:

1. Define the NFT object:
   - Create an object called "nft" with properties such as color, creator, value, and name.
   - Assign appropriate values to these properties.

2. Create an array to store NFT objects:
   - Initialize an empty array to hold the NFT objects.
   - Later, you'll push the "nft" object into this array.

3. Define a function to add NFTs to the array:
   - Inside the function, push the "nft" object into the array.

4. Define a function to list NFT details:
   - Create a function that takes the NFT array as a parameter.
   - Use a for loop to iterate over each NFT object in the array.
   - Inside the loop, access and display the details of each NFT object (e.g., color, creator, value, and name).

5. Define a function to calculate total NFT supply:
   - Create a function that takes the NFT array as a parameter.
   - Initialize a variable to keep track of the total supply.
   - Use a for loop to iterate over each NFT object in the array.
   - Inside the loop, increment the total supply by one for each NFT object.
   - Finally, return the total supply.

6. Test the code:
   - Call the function that adds NFTs to the array, passing the "nft" object as an argument.
   - Call the function that lists NFT details, passing the NFT array as an argument.
   - Call the function that calculates the total NFT supply, passing the NFT array as an argument.
   - Display the total supply value to verify .
